# School Assist: Mobile Application
Mobile Application developed during the Caribbean Science Foundation Coding Workshop Fall 2018. I collaborated with an artist and a tester to develop this application in 3 weeks. I was responsible for programmed the app's functionality and user interface.

## Technologies Used
Ionic V3  
HTML  
CSS  
Angular  
JavaScript
TypeScript  
Node.js  
Android Studio  

## Notes
- APK File included for demostration purposes.  
- Code written in 2018 with Ionic V3 before I learned about clean code and best practices.  
- Not all files to rebuild the app may be here.  

TODO: Restructure code, possibly migrate code to a more recent Ionic version
